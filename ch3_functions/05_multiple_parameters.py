# Multiple Parameters
# Functions can have multiple parameters ("parameter" being a fancy word for "input"). For example, this subtract function accepts 2 parameters: a and b.

# def subtract(a, b):
#     result = a - b
#     return result

# The name of a parameter doesn't matter when it comes to which values will be assigned to which parameter. It's position that matters. The first parameter will become the first value that's passed in, the second parameter is the second value that's passed in, and so on. In this example, the subtract function is called with a = 5 and b = 3:

# result = subtract(5, 3)
# print(result)
# # 2

# Here's an example with four parameters:

# def create_introduction(name, age, height, weight):
#     first_part = "Your name is " + name + " and you are " + age + " years old."
#     second_part = "You are " + height + " meters tall and weigh " + weight + " kilograms."
#     full_intro = first_part + " " + second_part
#     return full_intro

# It can be called like this:

# my_name = "John"
# my_age = "30"

# intro = create_introduction(my_name, my_age, "1.8", "80")
# print(intro)
# # Your name is John and you are 30 years old. You are 1.8 meters tall and weigh 80 kilograms.

# Assignment
# We need to calculate the total damage from a combo of three damaging attacks. Complete the triple_attack function by returning the sum of its parameters, damage_one, damage_two, and damage_three.

# The attacks (attack_one to attack_six) are already passed to two triple_attack functions for you, so you do not need to use them directly in the function.


def triple_attack(damage_one, damage_two, damage_three):
    return damage_one + damage_two + damage_three


# Don't touch below this line

# This is the first triple attack
attack_one = 2
attack_two = 4
attack_three = 3
first_triple_attack_damage = triple_attack(attack_one, attack_two, attack_three)

print("Getting damage for", attack_one, attack_two, "and", attack_three, "...")
print(first_triple_attack_damage, "points of damage dealt!")
print("=====================================")

# This is the second triple attack
attack_four = -1
attack_five = 10
attack_six = 5
second_triple_attack_damage = triple_attack(attack_four, attack_five, attack_six)

print("Getting damage for", attack_four, attack_five, "and", attack_six, "...")
print(second_triple_attack_damage, "points of damage dealt!")
print("=====================================")
