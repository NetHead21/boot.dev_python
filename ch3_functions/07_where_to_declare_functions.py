# Where to Declare Functions
# You've probably noticed that a variable needs to be declared before it's used. For example, the following doesn't work:

# print(my_name)
# my_name = 'Lane Wagner'
# # NameError: 'my_name' is not defined

# It needs to be:

# my_name = 'Lane Wagner'
# print(my_name)
# # Lane Wagner

# Code executes in order from top to bottom, so a variable needs to be created before it can be used. That means that if you define a function, you can't call that function until after it has been defined.

# Assignment
# There's a bug! It looks like we are trying to call a function before it was defined! Run the code and read the printed error, then fix it.

    print("Fantasy Quest is booting up...")
