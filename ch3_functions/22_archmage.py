# Archmage
# Congratulations on making it to the end of the functions chapter!

# This is one of the hardest chapters in the Python course - though dictionaries are no walk in the park either.

# You've probably already figured out that:

# Chests contain gems and items
# Gems can buy items in the shop
# Items help you earn achievements and XP
# XP levels you up, and higher levels unlock new roles
# So why should you care about your role?

# My guess is that you've earned enough XP to be an Apprentice by now. You can see your role at the top right of your screen. When you hit level 100, you'll unlock the final role, Archmage. It's kind of a big deal. When you hit archmage:

# You'll have learned a ton, built many real-world projects, and should be starting your job search
# You'll have unlocked all the private role-based chat channels in our Discord
# You'll have immeasurable bragging rights and a hoard of fake internet points
# You'll get a physical archmage coin in the mail as a token of your hard work


# Which role is highest in the Boot.dev hierarchy?

# Pupil
# Mage
#     Archmage
# Apprentice
