# None Return
# When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return None. For example, maybe it's a function that prints some text to the console, but doesn't explicitly return a value. The following code snippets all return the same value, None:

# def my_func():
#     print("I do nothing")
#     return None

# def my_func():
#     print("I do nothing")
#     return

# def my_func():
#     print("I do nothing")


# What happens if there is no 'return' line in a function?

# The program crashes
# It returns no values, an attempt to capture a return value will result in errors
#     It returns None
# Alan Turing rolls over in his grave


# What's the difference between printing a value and returning it?


# They are the same

# Print: Shows a value in the console.
# Return: Makes a value available to the caller of the function and shows it in the console

#     Print: Shows a value in the console.
#     Return: Makes a value available to the caller of the function

# Print: Makes a value available to the caller of the function.
# Return: Shows a value in the console
