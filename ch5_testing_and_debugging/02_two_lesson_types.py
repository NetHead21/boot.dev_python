# Two Lesson Types
# As we talked about, there are 2 types of coding lessons on Boot.dev:

# Console output lessons
# Unit-test lessons
# Console Output Lessons
# Only 1 file of code, usually with a comment explaining where to write your code
# When you "submit" your code, its console output must match the expected output exactly to pass
# Debug print statements will cause your code to fail submission, so remove them before submitting
# Unit-Test Lessons
# 2 files of code: main and main_test. You can read the tests but you can't edit them
# When you "submit" your code, the return values of your functions must match the expected values exactly to pass
# Console output is ignored, you can leave debug print statements in your code
# Which Is More Common?
# Going forward, you'll encounter far more unit-test lessons than console output lessons, but you'll still see both from time to time. Different concepts are better suited to different types of lessons.


# What type of lessons can you safely submit with your debug print statements left in your code?

#     Unit test
# Console output
