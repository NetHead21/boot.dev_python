# Sum Game
# Remember you can use in-place operators to increase or decrease a variable by any amount.

# number_of_enemies = 10
# number_of_enemies += 2
# # number_of_enemies is 12

# number_of_enemies = 10
# number_of_enemies -= 2
# # number_of_enemies is 8

# Assignment
# Fix the bug in the sum_of_numbers function. Instead of adding 1 to total at each iteration of the loop, it should add i. For example, instead of:

# 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1...

# we want:

# 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...

# The desired output is a single number after the loop has finished executing.


def sum_of_numbers(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += i
    return total
