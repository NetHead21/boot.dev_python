# Loop Review
# for i in range(0, 10):
#     print(i)

# Prints the numbers 0-9 to the console.

# Why would you want to use a loop?
#     To do the same thing over and over without writing the same code
# Because the computer understands loops better than repetitive code
# Because loops speed up your app


# Loop Review
# for i in range(0, 1000):
#     print(i)

# Prints the numbers 0-999 to the console.

# Why does the code on the left print 0-999 and not 0-1000?

# Because print(i) only happens while i is less than or equal to 1000
#     Because print(i) only happens while i is less than (not equal to) 1000
# Because print(i) only happens while i is greater than or equal to 1000
# Because print(i) only happens while i is greater than (not equal to) 1000
