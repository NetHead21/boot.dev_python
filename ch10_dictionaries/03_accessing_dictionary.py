# Accessing Dictionary Values
# Dictionary elements must be accessible somehow in code, otherwise they wouldn't be very useful.

# A value is retrieved from a dictionary by specifying its corresponding key in square brackets. The square brackets look similar to indexing into a list.

# car = {
#     "make": "Toyota",
#     "model": "Camry"
# }
# print(car["make"])
# # Prints: Toyota


# Which kind of brackets are used to access the values of a dictionary?

#     Square
# Parentheses
# Curly
