# Dictionaries
# Dictionaries in Python are used to store data values in key -> value pairs. Dictionaries are a great way to store groups of information.

# # use curly braces
# # add key-value pairs
# car = {
#   "brand": "Toyota",
#   "model": "Camry",
#   "year": 2019
# }

# Here the car variable is assigned to a dictionary {} containing the keys brand, model and year. The keys' corresponding values are Toyota, Camry and 2019.

# Assignment
# Complete the get_character_record function. It takes a character's name, server, level, and rank as individual inputs, and returns a dictionary with the following string keys:

# "name"
# "server"
# "level"
# "rank"
# "id"
# Create and return a dictionary with the keys above. Assign each of the four inputs to the matching key, ie: "name": name.

# Next, we can't have two characters named bloodwarrior123's on the same server! For the fifth key, id, create a unique value as follows:

# Concatenate the name and the server inputs with a # in the middle. For example, given:

# name = "bloodwarrior123"
# server = "server1"
# Then the id field would be set to bloodwarrior123#server1.

# Tips
# You can return the dictionary directly without assigning it to a variable.
# I recommend using an f-string to create the id field. This is a best practice.
