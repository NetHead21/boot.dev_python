# Iterating Over a Dictionary in Python
# We can iterate over a dictionary's keys using the same no-index syntax we used to iterate over the values in a list. With access to the dictionary's keys, we also have access to their corresponding values.

# fruit_sizes = {
#     "apple": "small",
#     "banana": "large",
#     "grape": "tiny"
# }

# for name in fruit_sizes:
#     size = fruit_sizes[name]
#     print(f"name: {name}, size: {size}")

# # name: apple, size: small
# # name: banana, size: large
# # name: grape, size: tiny

# We could have just as easily set the name variable to key or simply k.

# Assignment
# We need to display on our player's screens what the most common enemy in a given area of the game map is.

# Complete the get_most_common_enemy function by iterating over all enemies in the dictionary and returning only the name of the enemy with the highest count.

# If there are no enemies, return a None value. If there are multiple enemies with the same highest count, return the first one found.

# enemies_dict is a dictionary of name -> count. Example:

# {
#     "jackal": 1,
#     "kobold": 2,
#     "soldier": 3,
#     "gremlin": 5
# }

# Tip: Negative Infinity
# When you're trying to find a "max" value, it helps to keep track of the "max so far" in a variable and to start that variable at the lowest possible number, negative infinity.

# max_so_far = float("-inf")

# You'll also want to keep track of the enemy name associated with the maximum count. I would set the default for that variable to None.


def get_most_common_enemy(enemies_dict):
    if enemies_dict:
        return max(enemies_dict, key=enemies_dict.get)
    else:
        return None
