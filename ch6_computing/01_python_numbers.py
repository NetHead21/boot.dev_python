# Python Numbers
# In Python, numbers without a decimal point are called Integers - just like they are in mathematics.

# Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.

# Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:

# Addition
# 2 + 1
# # 3

# Subtraction
# 2 - 1
# # 1

# Multiplication
# 2 * 2
# # 4

# Division
# 3 / 2
# # 1.5 (a float)

# This one is actually a bit different - division on two integers will actually produce a float. A float is, as you may have guessed, the number type that allows for decimal values.

# Assignment
# Complete the missing sections of the calculate_damage function.

# Fix the total_damage variable so that it contains the sum of all the different weapons' and spells' damage values.
# Fix the average_damage variable so that it contains the average of the combined weapon and spell damage.


def calculate_damage(sword, arrow, spear, dagger, fireball):
    total_damage = sword + arrow + spear + dagger + fireball
    average_damage = total_damage / 5
    return total_damage, average_damage
