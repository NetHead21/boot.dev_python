# Plus Equals
# Python makes reassignment easy when doing math. In JavaScript or Go, you might be familiar with the ++ syntax for incrementing a number variable by 1. In Python, we use the += in-place operator instead.

# star_rating = 4
# star_rating += 1
# # star_rating is now 5

# Other Operators
# The other in-place operators work similarly:

# star_rating = 4
# star_rating -= 1
# # star_rating is now 3

# star_rating = 4
# star_rating *= 2
# # star_rating is now 8

# star_rating = 4
# star_rating /= 2
# # star_rating is now 2.0

# Assignment
# Complete the get_hurt function. It should use the -= in-place operator to subtract damage from current_health and then return the new current_health.


def get_hurt(current_health, damage):
    current_health -= damage
    return current_health
