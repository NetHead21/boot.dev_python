# Changing in Place
# It's fairly common to want to change the value of a variable based on its current value.

# player_score = 4
# player_score = player_score + 1
# # player_score now equals 5

# player_score = 4
# player_score = player_score - 1
# # player_score now equals 3

# Don't let the fact that the expression player_score = player_score - 1 is not a valid mathematical expression be confusing. It doesn't matter, it is valid code. It's valid because the way the expression should be read in English is:

# Assign to player_score the current value of player_score minus 1

# In this operation, the right-hand side (player_score - 1) is calculated first. Once we have the result, we update player_score with this new value.

# Assignment
# Complete the update_player_score function. It should add increment to current_score and then return the new current_score.


def update_player_score(current_score, increment):
    return current_score + increment
