# Floor Division
# Python has great out-of-the-box support for mathematical operations. This, among other reasons, is why it has had such success in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

# Floor division is like normal division except the result is floored afterward, which means the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. The // operator is used for floor division.

# 7 // 3
# # 2 (an integer, rounded down from 2.333)
# -7 // 3
# # -3 (an integer, rounded down from -2.333)


# What would be the result of 11 // 2 ?


# 6


# 5.5


# 5.0


#     5
