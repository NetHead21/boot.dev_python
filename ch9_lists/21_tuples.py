# Tuples
# Tuples are collections of data that are ordered and unchangeable. You can think of a tuple as a List with a fixed size. Tuples are created with round brackets:

# my_tuple = ("this is a tuple", 45, True)
# print(my_tuple[0])
# # this is a tuple
# print(my_tuple[1])
# # 45
# print(my_tuple[2])
# # True

# While it's typically considered bad practice to store items of different types in a List, it's not a problem with Tuples. Because they have a fixed size, it's easy to keep track of which indexes store which types of data.

# Tuples are often used to store very small groups (like 2 or 3 items) of data. For example, you might use a tuple to store a dog's name and age.

# dog = ("Fido", 4)

# There is a special case for creating single-item tuples. You must include a comma so Python knows it's a tuple and not regular parentheses:

# dog = ("Fido",)

# Because Tuples hold their data, multiple tuples can be stored within a list. Similar to storing other data in lists, each tuple within the list is separated by a comma. When accessing a list of tuples, the first index selects which tuple you want to access, the second selects a value within that tuple.

# my_tuples = [("this is the first tuple in the list", 45, True),("this is the second tuple in the list", 21, False)]
# print(my_tuples[0][0]) # this is the first tuple in the list
# print(my_tuples[0][1]) # 45
# print(my_tuples[1][0]) # this is the second tuple in the list
# print(my_tuples[1][2]) # False

# Tuple Unpacking
# You can easily assign the values of a tuple to variables using unpacking.

# dog = ("Fido", 4)
# dog_name, dog_age = dog
# print(dog_name)
# # Fido
# print(dog_age)
# # 4

# When you return multiple values from a function, you're actually returning a tuple.

# Assignment
# The Fantasy Quest character system needs a list of "heroes" to be able to run the game properly. Someone wrote some pretty nasty code, and the code in question creates a heroes list where every 3rd index defines a new hero. First their name, then their age, then whether or not they're an "elf".

# Fix the structure of the heroes list by changing it into a list of tuples, where each tuple represents one hero and contains their data in the same order.


def get_heroes():
    heroes = [
        ("Glorfindel", 2093, True),
        ("Gandalf", 1054, False),
        ("Gimli", 389, False),
        ("Aragorn", 87, False),
    ]

    return heroes
