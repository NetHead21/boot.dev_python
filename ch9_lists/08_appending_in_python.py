# Appending in Python
# It's common to create an empty list then fill it with values using a loop. We can add values to the end of a list using the .append() method:

# cards = []
# cards.append("nvidia")
# cards.append("amd")
# # the cards list is now ['nvidia', 'amd']

# Assignment
# We need to generate a unique user ID for each player in the game. An ID is just a unique number that identifies a user.

# Let's finish the generate_user_list function. In the body of the loop, use the incrementing value i as unique IDs and append them to the player_ids list.


def generate_user_list(num_of_users):
    return [id for id in range(num_of_users)]
