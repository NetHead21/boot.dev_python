# Lists Continued
# Sometimes when we're manually creating lists it can be hard to read if all the items are on the same line of code. We can declare the list using multiple lines if we want to:

# flower_types = [
#     "daffodil",
#     "rose",
#     "chrysanthemum"
# ]

# player_ages = [
#     23,
#     18,
#     31,
#     42
# ]

# Writing it this way helps with readability and organization, especially if there are many items or if some of the items are too long. Keep in mind this is just a styling change. The code will run correctly either way.

# When would you declare a list on multiple lines?

# When there are only a few items
#     When there are many items and it's hard to read them all on one line
# When the array contains strings instead of numbers


# Which types can be stored in a list?

# Strings
# Numbers
# Booleans
#     All of them
