# Find an Item in a List
# Practice the "no-index" or "no-range" syntax:

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

# Assignment
# We need to check if a player has a specific item in their inventory. In the contains_leather_scraps function, use the no-index syntax to iterate over each item in items. If you find an item called Leather Scraps, set the found variable to True


def contains_leather_scraps(items):
    # found = False

    # don't touch above this line

    # ?

    # don't touch below this line

    return "Leather Scraps" in items
