# List Operations - Contains
# Checking whether a value exists in a list is also really easy in Python, just use the in keyword.

# fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
# print("banana" in fruits)
# # Prints: True

# Assignment
# Our players have requested an in-game feature that will allow them to type in a weapon name to check if it's in the list of top weapons in the realm.

# Complete the is_top_weapon function. It should return True if the weapon is in the top_weapons list, otherwise it should return False.


def is_top_weapon(weapon):
    top_weapons = [
        "sword of justice",
        "sword of slashing",
        "stabby daggy",
        "great axe",
        "silver bow",
        "spellbook",
        "spiked knuckles",
    ]

    # don't touch above this line

    return weapon in top_weapons
