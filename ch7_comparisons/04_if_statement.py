# If Statements
# It's often useful to only execute code if a certain condition is met:

# if CONDITION:
# 	# do some stuff here

# # code after the if block may still run regardless

# For example, in this code:

# def show_status(boss_health):
#     if boss_health > 0:
#         print("Ganondorf is alive!")
#         return
#     print("Ganondorf is unalive!")

# if boss_health is greater than 0, then this will be printed:

# Ganondorf is alive!

# Otherwise, this will be printed:

# Ganondorf is unalive!

# Without a return in the if block, Ganondorf is unalive would always be printed:

# def show_status(boss_health):
#     if boss_health > 0:
#         print("Ganondorf is alive!")
#     print("Ganondorf is unalive!")

# This code could print both messages:

# Ganondorf is alive!
# Ganondorf is unalive!

# When you only want code within an if block to run, use return to exit the function early.

# Assignment
# Complete the print_status function.

# If player_health is less than or equal to 0, print the text dead to the console.
# Afterwards, whether or not the player is dead, print the text status check complete to the console.
# Tip
# Indentation matters! Indentation is what tells Python whether the body of a function or the if statement has ended. Also, don't forget the colon after your if statement : it is a required part of the syntax!


def print_status(player_health):
    if player_health <= 0:
        print("dead")

    print("status check complete")


# Don't edit below this line


def test(health):
    print(f"Player Health: {health}")
    print("Checking status...")
    print_status(health)
    print("=====================================")
