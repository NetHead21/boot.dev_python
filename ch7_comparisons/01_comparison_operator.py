# Comparison Operators
# When coding it's necessary to be able to compare two values. Boolean logic is the name for these kinds of comparison operations that always result in True or False.

# The operators:

# < "less than"
# > "greater than"
# <= "less than or equal to"
# >= "greater than or equal to"
# == "equal to"
# != "not equal to"
# For example:

# 5 < 6 # evaluates to True
# 5 > 6 # evaluates to False
# 5 >= 6 # evaluates to False
# 5 <= 6 # evaluates to True
# 5 == 6 # evaluates to False
# 5 != 6 # evaluates to True


# Assignment
# Complete the player_1_wins function. It should return True if player 1 has a higher score, and False otherwise.


def player_1_wins(player_1_score, player_2_score):
    return player_1_score > player_2_score
