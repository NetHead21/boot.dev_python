# Mount Rental
# Players can rent other players' flying mounts from the "Uper" ride sharing guild, but they must return the mount before they have used up all their time, or they will be charged a fee.

# Assignment
# Complete the check_mount_rental function. It takes two inputs:

# time_used - the amount of time the mount has been used in minutes
# time_purchased - the amount of time the character rented the mount for
# If time_used meets or exceeds time_purchased, then the rental is expired and greedy Uper will charge a fee, so the function should return the string "overtime charged"
# Otherwise, return the string "no charges yet"
# Bonus: Try to accomplish this without an "else" statement.


def check_mount_rental(time_used, time_purchased):
    if time_used >= time_purchased:
        return "overtime charged"
    else:
        return "no charges yet"
