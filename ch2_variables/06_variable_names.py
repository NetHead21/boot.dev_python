# Variable Names
# Variable names can not have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

# The creator of the Python language himself, Guido van Rossum, implores us to use snake_case for variable names. What is snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

# Name	Description	Code	Language(s) that recommend it
# Snake Case	All words are lowercase and separated by underscores	my_hero_health	Python, Ruby, Rust
# Camel Case	Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one	myHeroHealth	JavaScript, Java
# Pascal Case	Capitalize the first letter of each word	MyHeroHealth	C#, C++
# No Casing	All lowercase with no separation	myherohealth	No one: don't do this
# To be clear, your Python code will still work with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but can we please just have nice things? We just want some consistency in our craft.

# Which is valid camel case?


# hero_health


#     heroHealth


# HeroHealth


# HEROHEALTH


# Which is valid snake case?


#     hero_health


# heroHealth


# HeroHealth


# HEROHEALTH
