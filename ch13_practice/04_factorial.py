# Factorial
# A factorial is the product (multiplication result) of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number. For example:

# 1! = 1 = 1
# 2! = 2 * 1 = 2
# 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
# 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
# 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
# There's also a special case for zero:

# 0! = 1
# It's just 1 by definition of the fancy math folks (ivory tower types).

# Assignment
# Complete the factorial() function. It should return the factorial of a given number.
